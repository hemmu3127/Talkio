Developed an AI-powered **Speech-to-Speech** LLM Bot using **Flask** and **Socket.IO** for real-time interaction. The system converts user speech to text with **speech recognition**, processes queries with **Gemini 1.5 Flash** (including **image processing** for specific keywords), and delivers rapid responses by returning the **first 20 tokens** with **threaded webcam** and **microphone** handling. Responses are converted back to speech using **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)** for seamless communication.
